;; 9.8

; Suppose we're writing a program to play hangman.
; In this game one player has to guess a secret word chosen by the other player,
; one letter at a time. You're going to write just one small part of this program:
; a procedure that takes as arguments the secret word and the letters guessed so far,
; returning the word in which the guessing progress is displayed by including all the
; guessed letters along with underscores for the not-yet-guessed ones:

; > (hang 'potsticker 'etaoi)
; _OT_TI__E_

;Hint: You'll find it helpful to use the following procedure that determines how to display a single letter:

;(define (hang-letter letter guesses)
;  (if (member? letter guesses)
;      letter
;      '_))

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(define (hang-letter letter guesses)
  (if (member? letter guesses)
      letter
      '_))

(define (hang secret-wd guesses)
  (accumulate word (every (lambda (wd) (hang-letter wd guesses)) secret-wd)))

(hang 'potsticker 'etaoi)
