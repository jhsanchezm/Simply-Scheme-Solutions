;The expression (+ 8 2) has the value 10. It is a compound expression
;made up of three atoms. For this problem, write five other Scheme 
;expressions whose values are also the number ten:

;•	    	An atom
;•	    	Another compound expression made up of three atoms
;•	    	A compound expression made up of four atoms
;•	    	A compound expression made up of an atom and two 
;             compound subexpressions
;•	    	Any other kind of expression
